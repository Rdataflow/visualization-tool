A special type of [[dimension value]], which has a character-based [[schema > position]] and uses shared values (e.g. https://ld.admin.ch/time/month/2000-02).

Can appear in [[TemporalEntityDimension]].

### assumptions

- [[schema > position]] contains the full, formatted date â€“ according to its [[time unit]] (only for month and year), for other types it's not the case (see https://int.ld.admin.ch/time/semester/1960-H1, https://int.ld.admin.ch/time/quarter/1960-Q1, https://int.ld.admin.ch/time/week/1960-W01)
