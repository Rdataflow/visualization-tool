Welcome in the **Visualize developers docs**! ðŸ“Š

# introduction

This is a [digital garden](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought) that you can use to write down your ideas, thoughts and success (or failure) stories related to working on Visualize.

The goal of this documentation system is to remain close to the code and update the documents as you go, facilitating the exchange of information and documenting the application as its being developed.

# contributing

> [!faq] When to contribute?
> Whenever you feel the need to store some knowledge, feel free to add or modify an existing document so everyone working on the project can benefit from your knowledge and experiences. Examples include, but are not limited to, situations when you:
> 
> - had a difficulty orientating yourself around some part of the application
> - see an opportunity to improve things
> - received some external knowledge that's useful to Visualize
> - tried out something that didn't work
> - want to document some broader context of a given decision so its easier to maintain the application

As this documentation is a part of version control system, it might be a good idea to keep it up-to-date whenever you add or modify some feature. You could add a link to the relevant Markdown document directly from the feature, so it's easier to remember about updating the docs.

> [!tip] Perfect is the enemy of good
> As the purpose of this documentation is to facilitate exchange of information and storage of knowledge related to Visualize mainly for internal purposes, the docs do not have a template that you should use â€“ they can be really short, or more sophisticated, focusing on the information itself, not its packaging.
# recommended tools
The files we use for these docs and pure Markdown files, which makes it easy to use any tool you'd like to edit them.

However, you might notice a `.obsidian` folder inside the repository â€“ you might want to try the [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) editor that was used to kick-start this repository and is a nice tool to write the notes.
