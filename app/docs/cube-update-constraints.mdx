## Constraints

When updating a cube, you have to follow a number of rules to make sure that
the charts that rely on those cubes will continue to work.

- Structure of a dimension should not be changed, otherwise, if a filter relies on the dimension, it might
  not work anymore. Here are the properties of a dimension that should not change:

  - `a`: Dimension type
  - `qudt:unit`: Unit
  - `qudt:scaleType`: Scale type
  - `shacl:datatype`: Data type
  - `meta:dataKind`: Data kind

  Please refer to the [RDF Cube Schema](https://zazuko.github.io/rdf-cube-schema/#properties-0) to
  learn more about those attributes.

- Similarly, a dimension should not be removed (same reason: if it is used in a chart filter, the filter
  will not be correct when the dimension is removed)
- Observations should not be removed, otherwise a chart that shows only those observations via a data filter
  will not show anything anymore.

If you need to do any of those things, you should create a new cube.

If your cube is in draft, you can ignore those rules as chart owners know that they are
relying on something that is not finished and that can change.
