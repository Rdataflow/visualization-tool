> These mockups illustrate an exemplary user flow through the _Visualization Tool_.

## Home and Gallery

The user's first contact with the _Visualization Tool_. In addition to a description of the tool and it's purpose, several entrypoints are available. A prominent call-to-action invites to go to the Visualization Builder directly. The gallery of recently created visualizations invites to just view them or create own visualizations based off of existing ones.

## Chart Builder

The Chart Builder is the core of the _Visualization Tool_. It guides the user through an easy to understand process from selecting the right dataset to customizing a visualization, and finally publishing it.
