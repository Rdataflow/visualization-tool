> Text elements are based on MUI `<Typography />` component, with the variants described
> in the table below.

## Accessibility

The variants only refer to styles, they don't generate HTML semantics. For accessibility, always make sure that the headings hierarchy is correct. You can use \`rebass\`'s \`as\` property to explicitly specify the tag to use.

Example of a heading \`h1\` with the style \`heading1\`.

```jsx
import { Text } from "@mui/material"

<Typography  variant="h1" component="h1" >
 Heading 1
</Typography>
```
