<Meta of={HintStories} />


## How to use


Hints are variants of the \`Box\` components. As a convenience, they are also available as components with semantic names.

```jsx
import { Box } from "@mui/material"

<Box variant="error">
  An error occurred!
</Box>
```

is equivalent to

```jsx
import { Error } from "./components/hint"

<Error>
  An error occurred!
</Error>
```./hint.stories
